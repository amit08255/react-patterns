# Compound Components

## Introduction

Think of compound components like the \<select\> and \<option\> elements in HTML. Apart they don't do too much, but together they allow you to create the complete experience. The way they do this is by sharing implicit state between the components. Compound components allow you to create and use components which share this state implicitly.

> The idea is that you have two or more components that work together to accomplish a useful task. Typically one component is the parent, and the other is the child. The objective is to provide a more expressive and flexible API.

So the compound components API gives you a nice way to express relationships between components.

> Another important aspect of this is the concept of "implicit state."

The `<select>` element implicitly stores state about the selected option and shares that with it's children so they know how to render themselves based on that state. But that state sharing is implicit because there's nothing in our HTML code that can even access the state (and it doesn't need to anyway).

> This pattern allows creating expressive and declarative components, without unnecessary prop drilling. You should consider using this pattern if you want to make your component more customizable, with a better separation of concern and an understandable API.

Instead of jamming all props in one giant parent component and drilling those down to child UI components, here each prop is attached to the SubComponent that makes the most sense.

> Your component has great UI flexibility, allowing the creations of various cases from a single component. For example, the user can change the SubComponentsâ€™ order or define which one should be displayed.

Most of the logic is contained in the main component, aReact.Context is then used to share states and handlers all across children. We get a clear division of responsibility.

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <Toggle onToggle={on => console.log(on)}>
      <Toggle.On>The button is on</Toggle.On>
      <Toggle.Off>The button is off</Toggle.Off>
      <Toggle.Button />
    </Toggle>
  )
}
```

The actual full implementation of compound components with context and hooks:

```js
import * as React from 'react'
// this switch implements a checkbox input and is not relevant for this example
import {Switch} from '../switch'

const ToggleContext = React.createContext()

function useEffectAfterMount(cb, dependencies) {
  const justMounted = React.useRef(true)
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if (!justMounted.current) {
      return cb()
    }
    justMounted.current = false
  }, dependencies)
}

function Toggle(props) {
  const [on, setOn] = React.useState(false)
  const toggle = React.useCallback(() => setOn(oldOn => !oldOn), [])
  useEffectAfterMount(() => {
    props.onToggle(on)
  }, [on])
  const value = React.useMemo(() => ({on, toggle}), [on])
  return (
    <ToggleContext.Provider value={value}>
      {props.children}
    </ToggleContext.Provider>
  )
}

function useToggleContext() {
  const context = React.useContext(ToggleContext)
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error(
      `Toggle compound components cannot be rendered outside the Toggle component`,
    )
  }
  return context
}

function On({children}) {
  const {on} = useToggleContext()
  return on ? children : null
}

function Off({children}) {
  const {on} = useToggleContext()
  return on ? null : children
}

function Button(props) {
  const {on, toggle} = useToggleContext()
  return <Switch on={on} onClick={toggle} {...props} />
}

// for convenience, but totally not required...
Toggle.On = On
Toggle.Off = Off
Toggle.Button = Button
```



So the way this works is we create a context with React where we store the state and a mechanism for updating the state. Then the ```<Toggle>``` component is responsible for providing that context value to the rest of the react tree.

## Bonus Tips

### Passing data of all immediate children of a component

```React.Children``` provides utilities for dealing with the this.props.children opaque data structure.

```React.Children.map(children, function)```: Invokes a function on every immediate child contained within children with this set to thisArg. If children is an array it will be traversed and the function will be called for each child in the array. If children is null or undefined, this method will return null or undefined rather than an array.

```js
// Wrap all immediate children inside button

function Tester(props) {
  return (
    <>
      {
        React.Children.map(props.children, (item) => (
          <button>{item}</button>
        ))
      }
    </>
  )
}
```

**Note:** If children is a Fragment it will be treated as a single child and not traversed.

```React.Children.forEach(children, function)```: Like React.Children.map() but does not return an array.

```React.Children.count(children)```: Returns the total number of components in children, equal to the number of times that a callback passed to map or forEach would be invoked.

```React.Children.only(children)```: Verifies that children has only one child (a React element) and returns it. Otherwise this method throws an error.
