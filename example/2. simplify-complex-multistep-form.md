Every field of the form should be dynamic and easily configurable. When user press Next button, all data from this form should be accessible in next step form.

Every field of the form should be dynamic and easily configurable. When user press prev button, all data from this form should be saved and previous form should be loaded with it's saved data.

## Step 1: Split the form into high-level parts

The **idea is to centralize data store and states** so that things become simple. We will use same technique used in first example: Suppose you build the entire form in single component. When building complex applications we need to **remember the thumb rule that every component should have single responsibility**.

## Step 2: Split components to make every component responsible for one thing

When splitting components, we have to make sure it is easy to share states between all child components. The easiest way is to use compound component.
First thing here is that, we need a single container which can handle any number of forms and allow them to share states between them.

> Compound component pattern is best when you need to break complex component into simple components making them flexible as well as allowing to share states easier.

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <MultiStep data={{
        board: '', className: '', subject: '', chapter: '', topic: '', isCategory: false,
        type: 'MCQ', options: ['', '', '', ''], answer: '', solution: '', text: '', step: 0,
     }}>
      <StructureForm />
      <QuestionForm />
    </MultiStep>
  )
}
```

Above is high-level view of the final form components. **When splitting the components, first split them into high-level view where every component has exactly one thing to care about.**

* MultiStep component will act as container of all of it's sub-component forms. All states data will be stores here in React ```context``` and all child inside the
MultiStep component will use this context to get and update states data.

* Keeping states separate in one place, make other components inside question stateless and sharing state between all it's child becomes very easy.

* The compound component **provides flexibility to user** and user can change the layout of question form by rearranging the child components.

**When splitting components in high-level view, all child can itself contain other child components for UI of that part.**
Once splitting on high-level is done, next comes the part of integrating the low-level view of components.

## Step3: Building high-level view of components

The **trick is to convert components into API**. Using compound pattern we can build components that act as API. They will know nothing about the UI components and will only act as API to provide easy data sharing and handling between all children in it.

```js
import * as React from 'react'

const MultiStepContext = React.createContext()

function MultiStep(props) {
  const [state, setState] = React.useReducer((state, newState) => ({ ...state, ...newState }), { step: 0 });
  
  React.useEffect(() => {
    if(props.data) {
      setState(props.data);
    }
  }, [props.data]);

  const value = { ...state, setState };

  return (
    <MultiStepContext.Provider value={value}>
      {
        React.Children.map(props.children, (child, index) => (
          index === state.step ? child[index] : null
        ))
      }
    </MultiStepContext.Provider>
  )
}

function useMultiStepContext() {
  const context = React.useContext(MultiStepContext)
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error(
      `MultiStep type components cannot be rendered outside the MultiStep component`,
    )
  }
  return context
}

export default useMultiStepContext;
```

> QuestionForm component

```js
import * as React from 'react'

function Question(props) {
  return (
    <>
      {props.children}
    </>
  )
}

function Types({ types, component }) {
  const { type, setState } = useMultiStepContext();
  const Child = component;
  
  const onChange = (value, count) => {
    const options = Array(count).fill('');
    setState({ type: value, options });
  };
  
  return (
    <Child types={types} onChange={onChange} value={type} />
  );
}


function Text({ component }) {
  const { text, setState } = useMultiStepContext();
  const Child = component;
  
  return (
    <Child onChange={(value) => setState({ text: value })} value={text} />
  );
}


function Options({ component }) {
  const { options, setState } = useMultiStepContext();
  const Child = component;
  
  const onChange = (index, val) => {
    const optList = [...options];
    optList[index] = val;
    setState({ options: optList });
  };
  
  if(options.length < 1){
    return null;
  }
  
  return (
    <Child onChange={onChange} options={options} />
  );
}


function Solution({ component }) {
  const { solution, setState } = useMultiStepContext();
  const Child = component;
  
  if(options.length > 0) {
    return null;
  }
  
  return (
    <Child onChange={(value) => setState({ solution: value })} value={solution} />
  );
}


function Answer({ component }) {
  const { answer, setState } = useMultiStepContext();
  const Child = component;
  
  if(options.length < 1) {
    return null;
  }
  
  return (
    <Child onChange={(value) => setState({ answer: value })} value={answer} />
  );
}


function Submit({ onSubmit, component }) {
  const { solution, text, options, type, answer, board, className, subject, chapter, topic } = useMultiStepContext();
  const Child = component;
  
  const onClick = () => {
    onSubmit({ type, options, answer, text, solution, board, className, subject, chapter, topic });
  };
  
  return (
    <Child onClick={onClick} />
  );
}

Question.Submit = Submit
Question.Answer = Answer
Question.Solution = Solution
Question.Options = Options
Question.Text = Text
Question.Types = Types

export default Question;
```

Similarly we can create API for structure form.

This technique adds an abstraction and flexibility to the designed compound component. It allows the component to be so flexible that you don't have to worry about how UI is created. The compound component acting as an API handles all the data and states. It works similar to High Order Component where you pass components as props and those component don't have to worry about states. As long as child component has same props, it will always work. **This technique improves reusability of your component.**

```js
function QuestionForm() {
  return (
    <Question>
      <Question.Types
        component={InlineRadioList}
        types={[
            { name: 'MCQ', value: 'MCQ', count: 4 },
            { name: 'SAQ', value: 'SAQ', count: 0 },
            { name: 'LAQ', value: 'LAQ', count: 0 }
          ]}
       />
      <Question.Text component={TextArea} />
      <Question.Options component={TextInputList} />
      <Question.Solution component={TextArea} />
      <Question.Answer component={TextInput} />
      <Question.Submit component={Button} onSubmit={que => console.log(que)} />
    </Question>
  )
}
```

```js
function App() {
  return (
    <MultiStep data={{
        board: '', className: '', subject: '', chapter: '', topic: '', isCategory: false,
        type: 'MCQ', options: ['', '', '', ''], answer: '', solution: '', text: '', step: 0,
     }}>
      <StructureForm />
      <QuestionForm />
    </MultiStep>
  )
}
```
